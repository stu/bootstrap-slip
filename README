bootstrap slip
==============
Something not quite scheme, something not quite lisp.
Based on the tutorials by Peter Michaux at http://peter.michaux.ca/

For those following Peters tutorials, his code and mine differ a great
deal, probably the worst thing I did was use my own linked list code
rather than using a PAIR object, so all his code dealing with pair
objects for linked lists is completly different.

Also, I have a context being passed around for all global variables.

I dont think I have environments right (as per part 0.9)


Build
=====
Requirements;
- premake4
- re2c

re2c is used to generate the tokeniser. You can get re2c here;
http://sourceforge.net/projects/re2c/files/

Premake4 is used to generate the makefiles or solutions for your platform.

requires premake4 to generate the makefile. Get premake4 here
http://industriousone.com/premake

Generate your desired target build;

vs2008		Visual Studio 2008 (or Express)
vs2005		Visual Studio 2005 (or Express), SharpDevelop, or MonoDevelop
vs2003		Visual Studio 2003
vs2002		Visual Studio 2002
gmake		GNU Make (including Cygwin and MinGW)
xcode3		Apple Xcode 3
codeblocks	Code::Blocks
codelite	CodeLite

I have only tested "premake4 gmake" on mingw + linux, but not generating
VS or XCode solutions.
